                    <span class="bold">DNA</span> – Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is present in nearly all living organisms and contains the
                    instruction manual for how a body works. It carries a cell's genetic information and hereditary
                    traits within its two nucleotide strands – the twisted, ladderlike "double helix" that is commonly
                    seen in visual representation.

                <p class="text">
                    <span class="bold">Nucleotide</span> – A group of molecules, also known as bases, that form the building blocks of DNA
                    when linked together. DNA is comprised of 4 nucleotides: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.
                    These nucleotides are represented by 4 corresponding letters (A, C, G, T) and these letters
                    form pairs, e.g. AT, CG.

                <p class="text">
                    <span class="bold">Allele</span> – Any of the forms in which a gene for a
                    specific trait can occur. In humans, 2 alleles for each gene are inherited;
                    one allele from the mother and one allele from the father.
                    These paired alleles are represented by a combination of the DNA nucleotide letters (A, C, G, T).

                <p class="text">
                    <span class="bold">SNP</span> – Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most common type of genetic variation among
                    humans. Each SNP represents a difference in a single nucleotide (A, C, G, T).
                    When a SNP occurs, it can lead to differences in appearance, health or other traits.
                    Some SNPs have no observable outcome. There are roughly 10 million SNPs in the human genome,
                    and they are inherited, passed from parents to offspring.

                    <span class="bold">Genome</span> – A complete set of DNA, including genes, containing all
                    of the instructions needed to build and maintain a living organism. In humans,
                    a copy of the entire genome is contained in every cell in the body that has a nucleus.

                    <span class="bold">Gene</span> – Genes contain the step-by-step instructions that tell the body's
                    cells how to function and what traits to express. Each genetic trait generally has 2 alleles,
                    one allele inherited from each parent. Humans have roughly 20,000 genes. While all humans share the
                    same set of genes, our biological differences arise from the variations in the inherited alleles.

                    <span class="bold">Chromosome</span> – DNA is organized into pieces called chromosomes.
                    Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, with a copy from each parent. A person's genes are stored
                    along their chromosomes at specific positions.

                    Genetic variants are what make humans unique from one another. SNPs are common genetic variants.
