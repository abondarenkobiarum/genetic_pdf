                Like most things in life, your body is full of potential. Potential to feel and look good, potential to
                be healthier, potential to perform better.
            </p>
            <p class="text">But how do you know what your true biological potential is?
                Your biological data like weight, sleep, age and fitness,
                can indicate how your body is doing at a given moment in time...
                but your genes can help reveal your body’s potential.
            </p>
            <p class="text">Most of us spend our entire lives trying to unlock
                the positive potential hidden within.
            </p>
            <p class="text">Here’s the good news: you’re about to take a step towards doing just that,
                using cutting edge, personalized science. Combining genetic marker analysis with
                information about your personal habits, preferences, and biological data delivers powerful, actionable results.

        <h1>THINK OF YOUR GENES AS A UNIQUE SET OF INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <div class="columns">
            <div class="column">
                <p class="text">
                    This set of instructions is part of a genetic map you are born with: your DNA.
                    The DNA inside each of your cells contains genes that tell your body what to do,
                    how to do it, and when to do it – from building muscle and repairing skin, to your eye and hair color.
                    Your body is unique because the instructions for your genetic map are different from everyone else’s.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Now think of your nutrition and lifestyle habits, blood,
                    and biological data like weight and age, as the traffic moving along different routes on that genetic map.
                    The map stays the same no matter your chosen destination, but the traffic – how you get there,
                    which route is fastest or where there’s an accident – can always vary.
                </p>


            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <p class="text">
                    Your blood, personal habits and biological data, like traffic, reflect and influence current conditions.
                    They show how your body changes in response to its environment: what you eat, how you sleep,
                    age, stress, illness, even weather, can cause observable differences in how your body feels,
                    looks and performs.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    And while your genetic map tends to remain the same, the way your body reads the instructions
                    on that map can also change in response to external factors. Within your genes lies the potential –
                    both for amazing feats and things you may want to avoid.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Knowing what that potential is, and using your biological data to see how that potential is being
                    expressed, is the key.
