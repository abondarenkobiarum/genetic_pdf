                        We’ve used your Helix results, which include 261 of the 261 genetic markers we analyze.
                        Every DNA test covers a specific set of genetic markers; due to processing errors and other
                        unforseen technical circumstances, it is possible that not every marker will be sequenced.
                        Our algorithm includes adjustments for the missing markers to make our analysis of your results
                        as strong as possible.
